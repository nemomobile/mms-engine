        WAP push notification

        No information is available about the message other than
        its sender, expiry date and possibly the subject.

        Returns either zero (for manual retrieval) or positive
        record id which is passed back to messageReceived after
        message has been received and decoded.

        In the manual receive scenario, MMS engine does nothing about
        this message and may even shut down until its "receiveMessage"
        method is invoked.

        ===============================================================

        Message receive state update. No more such notifications will
        be issued after messageReceived has been invoked. In case if UI
        supports some kind of progress indication, may be extended with
        number of bytes received so far.

        If retrieval was started automatically (messageNotification
        returned positive database record id) then retries will be
        automatic too, i.e. Deferred/NoSpace state will become Receiving
        after a while and so on until message is either received, exires
        or gets deleted by the user.

        If retrieval was initiated manually, then retries will also be
        manual.

        If we allow the user to switch between automatic and manual
        retrieval modes then UI will need to notify MMS engine when
        this setting changes so that it can adjust its behavior
        accordingly.
